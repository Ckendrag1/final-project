# 🥦 Telegram Food Freshness Detection Bot

## 📌 Project Description
This project is a **Telegram bot built with Python** that uses a
**computer vision model trained with Teachable Machine** to determine
the **freshness of food products** from images.

The bot allows users to send a photo of a food item, after which it:
- analyzes the image using a neural network
- classifies the product as **fresh** or **spoiled**
- returns the prediction along with a confidence score

This project demonstrates a real-world application of:
- Python programming
- Machine Learning
- Computer Vision
- Telegram Bot API

---

## 🎯 Project Goal
The main goal of this project is to demonstrate how machine learning
can be used to solve practical problems such as **food quality assessment**.

During the project, the following tasks were completed:
- training an image classification model using Teachable Machine
- exporting the model to Keras format
- integrating the trained model into a Telegram bot
- processing and analyzing images sent by users
